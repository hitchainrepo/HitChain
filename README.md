## Research and Development
Hi there, our project is now on the process of internal development. During our exploring process, we plan to reward the developers who are making great contributions in OSS ecosystems. We are so sorry that our old repository has been flagged by GitHub because of advertising our rewarding plans imprudently. Now we have to create a new repository and publish our project step by step.
